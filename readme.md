## About
 
Hiddengems is an online thrift homepage that allows users to shop from selected secondhand clothes. It was the project to learn the process Agile method working as a team. This homepage was developed using only pure css. Using Tailwind and Daisy UI I rebuilt the homepage and I made it responsive for every device, such as mobile and desktop.
